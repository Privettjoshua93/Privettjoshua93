# Hi there! 👋

I'm a **Systems Engineer** at an MSP, and I'm passionate about expanding my skills in the world of tech. 🌐

## 🐍 Learning Python
Currently, I'm learning Python with the hope of one day being able to contribute to the field of computational neuroscience.

## 🤖 Working with Chat GPT
I've been working with Chat GPT 4.0, which means some of the projects you see here might be more advanced than what I could write on my own.
